# UFW-Rules-for-Home-Security
A few rules from UFW to keep your computer safe when you're surfing the web or playing games :)

# Warning!
This script for UFW is only for web browsing and gaming. Keep in mind that it will disable SSH connections, so you will not be able to access your computer remotely.
> You can reactivate SSH using this command: `sudo ufw allow ssh`

# Usage
You just need to give it execution permissions with this command: `chmod +x UFW_rules.sh`

And then, execute it with sudo: `sudo ./UFW_rules.sh`

# ENJOY :)
